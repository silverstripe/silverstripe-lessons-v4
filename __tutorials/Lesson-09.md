So far, we've only been dealing with content that is directly associated with a page, but often times, pages are made up of content that is stored outside the page, and merely brought into the page through a data relationship. We saw a bit of this in Lesson #7 when we created `$has_one` relationships to `File` and `Image` objects. All of the information about the file is stored on its own table, and the page merely references it. We're going to dig a bit deeper into relational data in this lesson by introducing some plural relationships with `$has_many`.

### What we'll cover

* Creating a generic `DataObject`
* Setting up a `$has_many` relationship
* Introduction to the `GridField`
* Working with relational data on the template

### Creating a generic `DataObject`

In this lesson we'll work on another static template called [`regions-page.html`][RegionTemplate]. Our designer has once again stripped away all the chrome and left us with just the `$Layout` section, so before we go any further, let's migrate the page into a SilverStripe template.

Copy the contents of [`regions-page.html`][RegionTemplate] into a new file, `app/templates/SilverStripe/Example/Layout/RegionsPage.ss`.

Then, create a new page type to go with it.

***app/src/RegionsPage.php***
```php
<?php

namespace SilverStripe\Example;

use Page;

class RegionsPage extends Page
{

}
```

***app/src/RegionsPageController.php***
```php
<?php

namespace SilverStripe\Lessons;

use PageController;

class RegionsPageController extends PageController
{

}
```

Run a `dev/build?flush`, and go into the CMS. Change the `Regions` page to type `RegionsPage` (on the Settings tab). Now go back to your website and click on "Regions." You should see the new layout.

All of this is static content, of course, and we need to start carving it up into something editable in the CMS. One of the most apparent features of this content is that it clearly belongs in a loop. We see the regions _Northeast_, _Southeast_, etc., all with the same structure and data. Each contains a title, a photo, and a short description.

We could hand this off to the rich text editor and create all this content in the `$Content` block, but that would be pretty ugly. Our content editor would have to take care to create very specific markup, and that would push the boundaries of WYSIWYG utility. We need to make each of these regions editable pieces of structured data.

Let's first create the `Region` data type. Just like we discussed in the previous lesson, generic, non-page content types should inherit from `SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject`.

***app/src/Region.php***
```php
<?php

namespace SilverStripe\Example;

use SilverStripe\ORM\DataObject;
use SilverStripe\Assets\Image;
use SilverStripe\Forms\FieldList;
use SilverStripe\Forms\TextField;
use SilverStripe\Forms\TextareaField;
use SilverStripe\AssetAdmin\Forms\UploadField;

class Region extends DataObject
{

    private static $db = [
        'Title' => 'Varchar',
        'Description' => 'Text'
    ];

    private static $has_one = [
        'Photo' => Image::class
    ];
    
    private static $owns = [
        'Photo'
    ];

    public function getCMSFields()
    {
        $fields = FieldList::create(
            TextField::create('Title'),
            TextareaField::create('Description'),
            $uploader = UploadField::create('Photo')
        );

        $uploader->setFolderName('region-photos');
        $uploader->getValidator()->setAllowedExtensions(['png','gif','jpeg','jpg']);

        return $fields;
    }
}
```
As described in a previous tutorial, the `$owns` array is used to ensure that when regions are saved, their related images are pubilshed as well. Files and images are, by default, draft until explicitly published. This ensures they'll be implicitly published with the page that uses them.

You might have noticed that our `getCMSFields()` function looks a bit different. That's because we're not going to be using the typical page editing interface for this object, so we're not going to have the tabs that come with Page objects. We could very easily create one, but since this data type is so simple, we'll just leave it as a simple field list, and add all the form fields to the constructor.

### Setting up a `$has_many` relationship

Now that we have our standalone `Region` object, we need to relate it to our `RegionsPage`. We know from our design that the page can contain any number of Regions, so for this, we'll use the `$has_many` relationship.

***app/src/RegionsPage.php***
```php
// ...
class RegionsPage extends Page
{
    private static $has_many = [
        'Regions' => Region::class
    ];
}
```

This follows the same convention as the `$has_one` we used in a previous lesson. The key, "Regions" is the arbitrary name we'll give to the relationship. It's the method we'll use to get a list of all the related regions. The value is the name of the related class.

Run a `dev/build` and see if you get any database changes. If you don't see any, **that is the expected result!** Why? Well, we're not quite done yet.

#### Reciprocating the `$has_many`

`$has_many` relationships are a bit of a special case because they have to be _reciprocated_ by the related class. While every `RegionsPage` has many `Regions`, it is also true that every `Region` has _one_ `RegionPage` that contains it. Regions cannot belong to any more than one region page.

This is important, because the database mutation happens at the `$has_one` level, not the `$has_many`. What will really bind these two objects together is a `Region` object providing one, and only one, `RegionsPageID`. Let's make that update now.

***app/src/Region.php***
```php
// ...
class Region extends DataObject
{

    // ...
    private static $has_one = [
        'Photo' => Image::class,
        'RegionsPage' => RegionsPage::class
    ];

    // ...
```

Typically, reciprocal `$has_one`'s like this can just be named after the parent class.

Now let's run a `dev/build` and see that we get a new `RegionsPageID` field.

### Introduction to `GridField`

We've got our `$has_many` relationship defined, with a `$has_one` on the other side, and we're ready to start populating the relationship with data. For this, we'll need one of the workhorses of the CMS interface – `GridField`.

`GridField` is a highly configurable form field that allows you to manage an arbitrary table of data. In its most primitive sense, you can think of it as an abstraction of a database table, but there's much more that you can do with it. To manage our `Region` objects, we'll want a tab on the `RegionsPage` that allows us to create, read, edit, and delete associated `Region` records.

Let's make the following update to our `RegionsPage` object.

***app/src/RegionsPage.php***
```php
// ...
use SilverStripe\Forms\GridField\GridField;
use SilverStripe\Forms\GridField\GridFieldConfig_RecordEditor;

class RegionsPage extends Page
{
    private static $has_many = [
        'Regions' => Region::class
    ];

    public function getCMSFields()
    {
        $fields = parent::getCMSFields();
        $fields->addFieldToTab('Root.Regions', GridField::create(
            'Regions',
            'Regions on this page',
            $this->Regions(),
            GridFieldConfig_RecordEditor::create()
        ));

        return $fields;
    }
}
```

#### The GridField constructor

Let's take a look at the argument signature for `GridField`:

* **`'Regions'`**: A required, arbitrary name for the `GridField`. You'll need this if you ever want to make updates to your `GridField` after it's been added to the `FieldList`.
* **`'Regions on this page'`**: A title for the `GridField`. Should be user-friendly.
* **`$this->Regions()`**: This is the most substantial component of your `GridField`. It populates the grid with data. In this case, we're using the magic method created by our `$has_many` relationship to fill the grid with all the records that are currently associated with the page.
* **`GridFieldConfig_RecordEditor::create()`**: This is a bit more complex. It creates an object that contains a number of `GridFieldComponent` objects, which provide various UI tools to the grid, such as pagination, an "add new" button, "delete"/"edit" buttons, etc. These `GridFieldConfig` objects can be configured with any variety of components you like, but SilverStripe ships with a few common configurations that are often used. `GridFieldConfig_RecordEditor` is a great one, because it provides all the basic UI you'd expect to have for managing data.

### Adding versioning

Right now, any changes we make to regions will go to the live site immediately, since they have no published/draft state. Let's start by adding versioning to those records.

***app/src/Region.php***
```php
// ...
use SilverStripe\Versioned\Versioned;

class Region extends DataObject
{
    // ...
    private static $extensions = [
        Versioned::class
    ];
    // ...
```

First, we apply a [`DataExtension`](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/extending/extensions/) called `Versioned`. We'll talk more about extensions in a future tutorial, but for now, just understand that this extension mixes functionality into the class to make it support versioning.

Run a `dev/build?flush` and we should see some new tables created.

Lastly, we need to declare ownership between `RegionsPage` and `Region` so that changes to publication cascades from parent to child, and vice-versa.

***app/src/RegionsPage.php***
```php
// ...
class RegionsPage extends Page
{
    // ...
    private static $owns = [
        'Regions'
    ];
    // ...
```


Notice that we don't need to use the fully-qualified class name, `Region::class`, in the `$owns` declaration. That's because we're referring to the relationship, not the class. The relationship is declared as `Regions` in the `$has_many` array. The entries in `$owns` could just as easily be method names, if you wanted to declare ownership in a custom getter.

Let's go back into the CMS and edit our "Regions" page. See that we have a tab now that contains a grid. Give it a try and add some test records.

#### Configuring the `GridField`

As stated earlier, `GridField` is highly configurable. One of the most common customisations you'll want to make to your grid is the columns that are displayed. In this case, there are only a handful of fields, so only showing `Title` and `Description` isn't so bad, but you can imagine that if the `DataObject` had 10 distinct fields, we would probably want to tighten that up a bit.

In our case, let's make a minor enhancement, and just add the `Photo` field to our list view. By default, only fields in the `$db` array get included. Since `Photo` is in the `$has_one`, we have to specifically include it.

Let's define a `$summary_fields` variable on our `Region` object.

***app/src/Region.php***
```php
// ...
class Region extends DataObject
{
    // ...
    private static $summary_fields = [
        'Photo' => '',
        'Title' => 'Title of region',
        'Description' => 'Short description'
    ];

    private static $searchable_fields = [
        'Title',
        'Description'
    ];
    // ...
}
```

This array maps the name of the field to the human-readable column name. We'll let the photo speak for itself and leave its column header empty.

Because we changed a private static variable, we need to run ?flush to see the update to the grid. How does it look? Pretty bad, right? The photo is not being resized to fit the grid.

#### Using a custom getter

Fortunately, `$summary_fields` accepts more than just field names. We can provide any public method on our `DataObject` as a column value. Let's create a method that returns a resized photo.

***app/src/Region.php***
```php
// ...
class Region extends DataObject
{
    // ...
    private static $summary_fields = [
        'GridThumbnail' => '',
        'Title' => 'Title',
        'Description' => 'Description'
    ];
    // ...
    public function getGridThumbnail()
    {
        if($this->Photo()->exists())
        {
            return $this->Photo()->ScaleWidth(100);
        }

        return "(no image)";
    }
}
```

Run `?flush` again, and see that our grid looks much cleaner now.

We could have saved ourselves a lot of time by using a method that SilverStripe provides to all `Image` objects by default – `CMSThumbnail()`. `Photo.CMSThumbnail` would have achieved a very similar result, without the fallback text _(no image)_.

#### Traversing fields

Another great feature of `$summary_fields` is that you can traverse relationships to get foreign fields, using a dot-separated syntax. Suppose we wanted to show the `Filename` field on the `Photo`:

```php
// ...
class Region extends DataObject
{
    // ...
    private static $summary_fields = [
        'Photo.Filename' => 'Photo file name',
        'Title' => 'Title',
        'Description' => 'Description'
    ];
    // ...
}
```

This type of syntax becomes especially useful when formatting dates, or getting the title of a related `$has_one` rather than just showing its numeric ID.

### Working with relational data on the template

Now that our relational data is all in place, it's time to display it on the template. This should be pretty straight forward. Let's start with `RegionsPage.ss`

***app/templates/Layout/RegionsPage.ss***
```html
<!-- BEGIN BLOG LISTING -->
<div class="grid-style1 clearfix">
    <% loop $Regions %>
        <div class="item col-md-12"><!-- Set width to 4 columns for grid view mode only -->
            <div class="image image-large">
                <a href="#">
                    <span class="btn btn-default"><i class="fa fa-file-0"></i> Read More</span>
                </a>
                $Photo.Fit(720, 255)
            </div>
            <div class="info-blog">
                <h3>
                    <a href="#">$Title</a></h3>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    $Description
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    <% end_loop %>
</div>
<!-- END BLOG LISTING -->
```

Notice that we're skipping over the links. We'll address that in a future lesson.

### Take a backup

Include the `region-photos` to git by changing the content of the `.gitignore`-file in the `assets`-folder as followed:

***public/assets/.gitignore***
```ignore
/**/*
!.gitignore
!.htaccess
!web.config

!/.protected/
/.protected/*

# Ignore everything but travel-brochures, travel-photos and region-photos
!/**/travel-brochures/
!/**/travel-photos/
!/**/travel-*/**/*
!/**/region-photos/
!/**/region-photos/**/*

# Ignore mutated files
**/*__*.*
```

Once more take a backup of your database to save the progress you've made:

```bash
mysqldump -hdb -uroot -proot -B SS_html > .devcontainer/initdb.d/database.sql
```
